"How does Bugs are a biting relate to Yikes...today was horrid.  Awakened from my slumber amid a blast of cold air and a Shocking Sound blaring from my alarm.  The worst dream ever, could not be called a nightmare, because it contained secret wishes within its terrorizing plots.  What the hell did I eat last night; what did I think in passing to make my subcontious conjure up such a disturbing scenario?  He's not even dead and the other isn't even an aquaintence. Two nights in a row, he's been dead...  The blatant symbolism lies in the ""death"" of our friendship, but why now?  Its been almost 3 years since we've even spoken....the last words from his mouth being, ""I'll see you later...I promise"".  Is this what he meant?  He'll see me in my mind's eye and plaugue me with frightening images of the entire friendships' highs and lows played out in a fraction of the time with severity and dark undertones.  
Of course, once fully awakened, my physical state had been disturbed as well.  My wrist was itching and swollen...  Something fucking bit me!  There's no bite....oh well...
I get to work, all the while annoyed with my wrist and the last image of the dream, while feeling abnormally cold.  The first assignment ...done...The second task....-fin-.....the third...augh!!! I pass out....I wake up yet again in a state of annoyance and bewilderment...covered in a cold sweat.  Yay!! no one walked in while I was laying on the floor.

Hometowns are somewhat perplexing.....How is that defined?  I dont think I have one.  When people ask where I'm from I really dont know what to say. I wasn't raised here during my elementary years. Freud says thats when our personalities are developed...before the age of six.  If thats the case, I should still glance up at every stranger with an expecting smile, shyly asking, ""how do you do?""  But then we made our way just a tiny bit north....my whole world was changed.  Rick Astley....  Debbie Gibson....augh!!!!  
Yet again, everything changes as fast as I adapted to my plaid skirts changing colors and pride to assimilate the knee high socks, we moved again. When I heard we were ""visiting"" Ohio I was soo excited...Ohio....wow...thats really far from California....  Yes, it is....too bad our actual destination was Idaho!  
I spent the next ten years of my life trapped in a sprawling wasteland full of idiot rednecks, nazi's right-wing geriatrics, and trendy kids who picked up the styles of 6 years prior only to copy them in such a haphazard has-been manner that the only comments they could share with a ""freak"" such as myself, is ""look at her hair"" as they passed me on their way to class.  I had spit in my hair as I left the bus.....When I returned I kicked his ass...
I stopped riding the bus after that.  Noone likes a mean girl..noone likes a bitch.  Noone accept the other rejects.  I listened to better soundtracks in accord with my life ...in the processes of my ascent to freedom from giving a Fuck.

"How does 911 is a joke in yo town relate to Aside from the constant barage of Suits asking if I worked for the Mail Room (which I dont) in a condescending manner, my day was uneventful.  I had coffee with Aaron, and we discussed the decline of America and the dream for hired assisins that we elaborate on during such meetings.  Logic vs. Equations.... the possibility of playing chess during this hour rather than our usual banter.  How we are going to spend out jaunt to Seattle.  Mix and Mingle...  
that is until....
dunn dunnnn duuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!

Stephanie calls me at work aprox:1642 in a whispery voice....""I need to talk to you!""....""what??!!""  ""the lady downstairs is getting the crap beat out of her""...""I dont know what to do""....""call the cops""....""is Travis there"" (travis..5 years old, super cute, makes own rules for soccer, loves to talk about how weird girls are).  ""yes, he's crying and saying,'Dont hurt my mommy!'"" ""augh!!""....""leave, and I'll call the cops""....
so I did .....I called the cops...they showed up and as trite as this scenario is, she didn't press charges.  Since this in Idaho,and women are subhuman there are no laws in place to protect victims of domestic violence....or even the little innocent soccer playing kitten chasing cute boys. Normally, children annoy the living shit out of me, but he's so fucking adorable...maybe its because he's so carefree, maybe I feel sorry for him, He wont cry in front of me.  So young yet so isolated.  He's not allowed to play with other children, so he entertains himself with us...the twenty somethings above him.  Jeremy and Aaron teach him the ""established"" rules of soccer...I give him paint samples and he thinks he's conned me....  He gets a dime everytime he doesn't flip off the stairs.....  I told him he'll become a quadrapelegic if he does and that he'll never be able to move again......  learned him gud.  

So my day sucked and I want to steal Travis away from his fucked up drug dealing/bike stealing father......

"How does scared straight relate to Today was charming in the way any small town is that embraces quaint clusters of people chatting over cups of coffee under an outstretched awning.  I was there to see a band... but they did not show.  It turns out little boy wonders' mommy needed him.  How adorable.  There will be no show tonight.   Possibly at the neurolux but I've tired of that circle of 20 something post grunge neo-indie pot smoking beard growing bunch.  I've only frequented the place long enough to catch its vibe.  Same ole' Same ole'.  I'll take you home long enough to gratify my immediate urges, than discard you in every way possible....leaving you to live out the rest of your local existence as I ordained.  No Thanks...I'll sit idly by watching this recycled scenario play itself to the brink of death.  I'll support the local music but I wont support your ass so get off my couch!...
So, yes it is truely admirable to see one of this towns few ""gentlemen"" publically admitting he has, and actually respects his mother.  I'll think twice now...  I've already thought it out more than that...  Maybe I was wrong...the seeminly jockist attitude was more a reflection of the many beers consumed that night...  I know I was guilty of being intoxicated.  Now there are two reasons on the pro column and only one superficial reason on the ""con"".  So overly superficial in fact I cant even type what it is...

I wanted to go today but I couldn't because ""HE"" was there.  so was l'autre homme....Damn it!!! He said I was ""weird"", actually he said, ""hehehehe you're soooooooooooo weird.""... And I said, ""S******, you're brother is soooooooooo rude""....to which he said, ""no I just have to tell a girl when her lipstick is on her teeth""...Blasphemy!!

What the hell is wrong with me?!!! I have a crush on my friends brother!!!!!!!!!  augh!!!!!!  KILL ME NOW!!!!!  He's so jazzily great!!!  and worse yet, is its sooo obvious...I dont hide these things well.  I should mention he was all smiley through this whole thing.  I get so uncomfortable around him, when its just me and him.  He knows...oh yea... he knows...He's sexed up this entire town, and then some...  A sultry few in seattle, nevada, California, Oregon, Japan, Germany maybe....  He's a slut!!!! I know this, he knows I know this, she knows he knows I know this, 
yet noone says anything.  This is so reverse of how it should be.  I'm used to my friends having crushes on my brothers and THAT I could deal with....  but on the flipside, I know how much it sucks to have one of your friends into yo brotha....it completely blows!  So, of course aside from the obvious avoidance of STD's, and being added to the list, I cant pursue this....Damnit!!!  Plus, we've been friends for years and I'm not one of THOSE girls.

Okay, anyone with words of wisdom or something satifyingly distracting, please comment on this crappy situation.

Two of my friends, over here in Ideeho, lets call them....Steremy and Jeffanie are celebrating their glorious one year anniversary...yay for them.... boo for anyone who ever knew them.

I introduced them several years ago, and I'm kicking myself for it, because they've turned into exactly what it is that I despise in cohabitant lovuhs.  She's his mommy who tells him what he likes, what he can do, who he should associate with...etc.  And he is her whipping boy in more ways than one.  

Three weeks ago .....

Jeffanie and I were at the Boise Cafe soaking in some culture over cups of tainted coffee and soy...  She got really silent and dismissive (anything I said, was meandering and pointless...it usually is anyways, but c'mon dont make me AWARE of it!!!).  I asked her, like any curious patron, what the hell is wrong with you?..only a little more perfumed and nice.  She just shrugged her shoulders in that annoying...I dont want to talk about it way...that for the record...I HATE!!!!  Whats the point of giving off signals that somethings wrong if you're not willing to discuss it?  

So, like any frustrated and ignored friend, I drove her home...  I even put on some joyful music... super noise pop infiltrated with glee.... I thought it would make her cheer up.... What do I know?  So, as we approached her house, we saw STeremy walking down the street, and like some lovesick whore, she screamed, ""stop the car!!"" and immediately jumped out....""steremy!!!! Oh I love you!!"" as they embraced like they hadn't seen eachother since the wall went up in Berlin..both being trapped on opposing sides..only there was no damned wall, and it had only been 3 hours since they'd last embraced... Gimme a break! 

So, I parked...they walked up with arms linked....oh how nauseating....

At this point, she acted like I no longer was there...in fact she does this every damn time he shows up.  I'll ask her a question and she'll completely ignore me...so he answers.  So, that little story played itself out as I asked if they wanted to go downtown.  Steremy said, Yea!  She looked at me and ignored the question.  

So, if this were an isolated incident, I could get over it and move on with my life not holding any type of grudge, but NO, no no ...my friends, this has been repeating itself for the last 8 months and honestly I'm soo damned sick of it.. NO more... the fucked up thing is that Steremy is still cool to be around, its just Jeffanie.

So, last friday STeremy got liquored up at  Ye Olde"" Pub, Neurolux and I just laid it all out on the tiny table.....YO, you're girlfriend, my Former friend, sucks to be around.... in much nicer words.  He actually .....shock, dismay, gasp....disbelief!!! AGREED!!!!

Apparently this is no friend issue.  She gets mad when he reads a book and doesn't give her his full attention... and when he wants to watch one of his many italian horror films...(?), she gets mad...for the lack of attention...  So, as we drank more, it was getting clear that my non-prescence in their relationship over the last 3 weeks, has sorta made these issues more pressing.  He has no escape...none ..bwa bwa hahahhahahahaa!!!!  

So, he made it evident he wants to break up with her....only it was kinda creepy because he says these...lets just say ""weird inuendo latant"" comments that make me feel really uncomfortable.

So, speed ahead..... Monday..

*Angry Message on my Telephonic Message Box* ..
""Jenny, Call me when you get home !!!!!!!""  (love always, Jeffanie)

Of course I didn't call, because I sorta got the feeling some sort of catastrophic control was lost on her part and I was now the Naying Scape Goat!!!  (naying, says suzanne the goat expert)....or she says, ""grunting"".....   

Hell no.... so was I wrong to not address the issue.... am I just a suck ass bitch?  I think I was in the right...

What do you think?

Currently I've encorporated the help of Private INvestigator, Aaron...code name Flying Pie.  He made contact with Jeffanie only last week.

I didn't think this out properly.  I""m now reduced to the mix tape I made years ago, still getting worn out.  The order of the songs like a Television  compilation commercial playing in your head.  The songs no longer posess their individual greatness, but now are like some neverending trail of song....  Tainted...  

The coffee boy across the street was extremely happy today.  Its almost comical how nice he is.  I got the official introduction.  I'm now known as the ""dinosaur jr"" girl.  which is odd since the only reason I wore that shirt that particular day was because my Sebadoh t-shirt was filthy... uh ok I'm full of shit.   But it did have something to do with that being the only clean shirt.  ""Evan"" professes to love J Mascis....  uh....okay.  I'm more of a Lou Barlow girl myself.  Freed Weed baby!! woo!!!  I'm a geeeeenius....

So, we made him a Wowee Zowee Poster and put it in the huge tip ""vase"" and noone even noticed so he may or may not get it.  Maybe the punk who gave me the jacked up scone will get it...  ITs a hobbesian world out there so I suppose the toughest barrista deserves the poster....even though we did make it for Evan.  Sorry.  

Cuteness personified.

So, hmm..... I'm contemplating what to do for lunch....its very soon. I want to go to Bear Head Park, but I kinda want to go to the Record Exchange and buy a ....(fkafjadfj;) single.

We went to the one across the street, and had a smoke with Evan Coffee Boy, and it turns out he's a Matador kid, and frowns on the Calvinites (K)....justified I might add.  I'm getting over my affliction with K, and its proving to be mighty difficult.  I love much of the music, but I'm torn because of the head megalomaniac behind the label.  Once finding him to be a mysterious awe inspiring genious of beatnikiliciousness, I fantasized of walking into a random coffee shop and eyeing him as he poured his soy milk into his steaming cup of........(you get the point)...

The only thing steaming in reality is the load of shit he represents.  So, after 8 years of devoting my crushcore self to him I'm dethroning him from the hierarchy and he now sits behind yet another lad.  

Work has been steady today, and it still seems as if I'm doing absolutely nothing.  We've been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen and Ride all day and I need a break so now we're going to put onnnnnnnnnnnnn.......uh......................  ""This is Next Year-a Brooklyn based compilation""...which is pretty self explanitory.  

So,  it seems there is noone to meet in this town... I'm sure that cant possibly be true, but where the hell are all these mysterious people?  Whenever the Sotano has a show this amazing turnout of music devotee's shows up, but then they are never to be seen in the daylight.  Where are you?  C'mon!!!  

Unwound is this Thursday and I'm seriously hoping I run into Paul of Paul and Sara inc.  He's been completely out of my life for almost three years and that is just so damned wrong. I miss his zany attitude... although I dont miss Sara in the slightest... okay thats a lie.  I miss the deceptive one that I thought was my friend for 5 years.  In the glow of my naive youth, I enjoyed her company and sincerely valued all she had to share.  (flashback to 1998)

......we were walking by what used to be ""coffee news"" and I saw my then boyfriend, Dave sitting outside with some other rockalosers, having totally forgotten that he was supposed to be having lunch with me per his request.... which is why Sara had come to rescue me from the slumps of despair and rejection.  Like any angered yet sophisticated girlfriend, I approached him and said, ""hey, whats up""?  to which he replied, ""hey baby, we're playing chess, call me later"".......(or something to that affect).... psh!!!!  I acted casual..I was casual Jenny....  shrugged it off enough to get around the building obstructing his view of my tears....  I couldn't help it....what an ass.  So, Sara and I sat down on the steps of a building downtown, while I half cried, half laughed.  She was doing her best to cheer me up.  She was always good at that....telling me what a loser he was... (he was!..still is!!) and that I could do a million times better, although I've yet to do that.  (many comparible).   As I concealed my tears with laughter, these two toothless gentlemen decided to approach us.  Now, I'm no freaking beauty but 'sheesh' that was really not what I needed.. (drunk toothless homeless hitting on me)...yea yea yea...PC bullshit..they are people too, but even had they been millionaires, I'm not particularly attracted to 50 something year old men...  least of all alcoholics.  It was 12 o'clock!!!   Well, after we politely bowed out, she was soooo super cute.

He's been pissing me off a lot lately.  Yesterday, he commented to the mailroom boys that I smoked crack, which asside from how lame a comment it is, its offensive.  So, today he decides to play his little power trip game at my expense.  I'm seriously infuriated.  The complete lack of conceiving how long it takes to process his request of muthafucking 50,000 sheets is aggrivating.  After entering our office, he immediately sets in on invading my desk.  Usually he goes through my cd's and whatever items are laying out, but today he went through Suzanne's.  I felt overjoyed to be on the phone with the US Dept of Education because it meant I wouldn't have to speak with him, but no...oh no no no.  He sarcastically instructed Suzanne to make ""me"" do the project.  It was said in a very condescending manner... as if, why are you doing this, when that idiot over there can?  She of course payed no attention to his stupidity and kept on working.  After realizing she wasn't going to join him in his retarded game, he came over to my desk and told me to ""shhhh shhhh""....to which I said, ""dont shhh me"".  He then asked for my manager muttering how he'd seen me earlier in the day at a coffee shop talking for and hour (lies) and outside smoking for another hour (lies)...I explained despite futility, that those are called ""designated breaks"" and by law we are entitled to them.  He of course could not stomach such blasphemy and got in my face.  He then demanded I dial the phone number of my boss for him.  I said, if you want to call her, you may do so however I'm not going to dial it.  So, the asshole fucking calls her at home, all the while keeping his face within inches of mine, staring me down.  Then he tells her I have an attitude problem, but otherwise am a good employee....I seriously fucking hate him....he's sick.

For the past few weeks I've meant to get in contact with my brother, Albert, but somehow I keep forgetting.  I could pretend I'm just too busy, but I'm not.  I have nothing to do, really.  Aside from my daily coffee indulgences, and local chit chat, my schedule is pretty much empty.  

Yesterday, I had this scary anxious desire to walk out of my job.  All because the tab settings were pissing me off and I had to throw away hundreds of sheets of paper.  I've never been a huge environmentalist, but somehow,  always friends with them, so I'm hyper aware of how much of the resources are wasted.  Well, obviously working with tons of paper, some is inevitably going to be thrown out.  I simply had no idea how much...  For instance, you cant recycle Color Expressions Paper, Dyed Paper, Textured Paper, or Tabs, yet all come from the same source...  All we recycle is the plain 20# Bond... which is usually not screwed up in high volumes...oh and we cant recycle Card Stock...  I'm going to hell.

So, I was online last evening speaking to my recently transplanted friend now in Boston, and she got a bit irate with me.  I think she's homesick.  I'm homesick...but my definition is different.   Also online was my charming former roommate, Robert from Boston, now in Ca.  What a nice guy he was...  I remember all the times we'd walk down the streets of Long Beach and I'd listen to his horrid tales of being jacked over by Jen Snay's roommate Sandy, a.ka. ""Asreal"". So I haven't spoken to him in months, and after all the shit I heard from him, you'd think he'd want to stay in Boston and never see the behemaut again.  Aahhhh, but alas, he's living amidst her evilness, as I'm sure I'm now the evil wench who convinced him to avoid her magesty.  Screw them all!!!  How on earth do these people say anything with a straight face?  She was jealous of my cats death!!! What the hell is that?  Apparently his death brought on too much sympathy... Fuck sympathy!!  I'm not some reactionary emotional glutton...  oh...wait, maybe I am.  

So, at this point I'd prefer complacency and maybe electroshock therapy.  I dont want to think anymore.  I cant even articulate the thoughts... let alone type them.  And oh god.... multi-tasking will be the death of me for sure.  I'm already cluttered, why must we throw in separate jobs for me to do simultaneously?  Its just too early for me to be here.  I wish I was still 8 years old playing ""freeze tag"" with the neighborhood kids in the yard.  Or riding my bike with that complete abandonment that makes me forget I'm even in a world with other people.  
How lonely could I get if there were noone else here?  There is noone else ""here"" currently and I'm actually really calm accept for my burning desire to go upstairs and get more coffee..... More coffee will sweeten this whole altered-reality in the plaza.  

One more immediate thought.  Why am I Catholic?  Why do I fear god?  Why did that sentence make me tense even typing it?  If god is real and I'm not a victim of being young and in my parents hands, than why do I constantly doubt this whole religion?  Not only doubt it...but I mean, It doesn't make sense... no religions do.  Once having being yelled at by my atheist best friend, ""your too intelligent for this!!  Why do you still believe it!!""  as I cried, unsure of really how to answer that.  I suppose the christian answer is faith.  But aside from George Michael's ass shaking, that word means nothing to me.  If I'm truely catholic, why do I place my suicides in a fate other than hell?  Catholics have all these rules.  I make acceptions.  Scott is NOT in hell.... I honestly believe this... and I dont think Gay people are evil...thats absurd.  I never go to confession because I'm ""afraid"" of being excommunicated....whats that about?  I already know we stole tons of fables from the Zoarastrians.  So, why the fuck do I still call myself a Catholic? Why am I afraid to just let go!?  My brother has....although he's let go of many things.  I'm actually freaked out that I would even question this.  I'll dream of plaid skirts and white shirts, and required knee high socks... as we are slammed with the yard stick for bending our elbows on the ledge of the alter, and I ate meat on friday, and forgot ash wednesday, and didn't so anything for easter.

"How does Yard Sales, Camping, Janes Addiction, Driving out of State, and Built To Spill relate to After much debate as to whether or not I should call, I surrendered my ego and gave Jeremy a ring.  He is one of my best friends and I miss seeing him around.  If I am going to be in this state, I might as well enjoy the company of those who voluntarily submit themselves to being locals.  Our discussions aren't interesting anymore though.  He's upset that his girlfriend is a tyrant and resents that I'm not a willing participant in her manipulative games.  I sensed his walking the edge as he spoke.  I know he wants to be mad at one of us...me or her.  He knows I'm not going anywhere, so maybe I'm the easy target to be dismissed... but somehow I dont see him doing that.  I'd expect that from someone with less integrity, but not of him.  I feel bad for him, in that he's ""trapped"" in this lease-bound relationship, where he isn't allowed to do any of the things that make him who he is.  To be an emotional prisoner, living your life soley to comfort someone elses lacking personality.  Not to sound completely against her, but she's CHANGED!!! not in the gradual way that most do... but in a drastic psychotic way that you fear.  I'd speak with her, but I dont have anything to offer in a positive light that wont tip her to the defensive or help the situation.  So, as we were ending the coversation, I hear this blaring ""I CANT BELIEVE YOU TALK ABOUT ME WHEN I'M IN THE NEXT ROOM!!""  It was Stephanie, sharing her comments with anyone in a 5 block radius.  So, I simply ended it, ""I gotta go...bye""...

I gotta go now too.......its LUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"How does Please forgive me Jose Jones relate to I'm saving money finally for the big move to another villa.  I'm oversaturated with mix tape lovin' and lovin' it.  

Last evening, we were dining at a ""family restaurant"", and as we departed these boys in an enormous pickup truck, yelled, ""Cherish whats on your windshield!!"".  We feared it was going to be some vile substance, but it was in fact an idiotic ""wanted"" poster for Osamu Bin Ladin.  So I graciously removed it and ripped it up and these fucked up boys gasped.  They then began some kind of chanting that I'm a ""pakistani lover""and was from Afghanistan.  So I yelled back that I was from Packistan..and their yelling got a bit frightening so we peeled outta there...

This is exactly the shit I dont want to deal with...god forbid I really was from Pakistan, would I have gotten the ass kicking of a lifetime? 
So, I'm putting it behind me or I'll be consumed with hate much like theirs.  So I hear we're at War as I wake up and exchange casual banter with my friend's neighbor.  On such a beautiful day, why do I have to represent something that destroys others?  I'd defect but lets face it, where the fuck would I go?  I'm a hypocrite, because I know nothing other than my comfortable existence, which despite the trivial shit I deal with, creates a comfort zone.  I've never been in fear of my life or woke up not knowing whether my brothers were murdered or imprisoned.  Growing up as a little tot, I lived in poverty but was so unaware of my social lackings.  I had a childhood so sheltered by my mom's sacrifices.  She gave up most conveniences to disguise the poverty.  I remember the free lunches at the park, but I thought we did that so we could play.  Awwww...ignorance is bliss.  And she recalls how she spent saved money to buy me dresses because I was her little girl.  I hated all clothes at that time...so she could've spared me that extravagance, but I'm still greatful, since in pictures we will appear to be nothing other than a nuclear family, and isn't that what this world loves?  Appearances. 

My brothers both verbally assaulted me yesterday because I said Dire Straights was horrid music.  I'll stand by my comment, but to label me as being a superficial snob because of that, hardly seems accurate.  I hate arguing with Albert because he can always shoot you down, with his vast anals of knowledge filed neatly in his memory.  I think we ended on good terms, and as a nonsequitor to tie this meandering editorial togther, I'm glad they aren't younger than me.  If they were I'd fear they were going to be shipped off to fight some fucked up War against the people in the mirror.  We are everything we hate in Afghanistan.  Money is our motivator, and Bush is the cowardly Tyrant hiding behind his Pen.  Hobbes..... why do you have to be so right??","Sorry, no answer found for Please forgive me Jose Jones."

"How does Memo:Please note the following changes to your process relate to Today I embark on yet another fucked up angry nothing.  I'm no longer able to go to the coffee shop across the street due to my thriftiness.  Smoking is a thing of the past, as I cant justify buying cigarettes and not coffee.....  I'm in love with my mix o' tunes sent by Maria, and its odd that I forgot how much I love getting mix tapes....I'm so consumed with producing them... 

I could barely lift my head this morning, not that I ever really want to wake up.  My mother's suspicion that my sleeping patterns are the product of depression are unfounded, as she has no idea of my concious day's activities.  I'm just not a morning person....to be cliche and honestly if given the chance I'm positive I could sleep through an entire day...without concern for lost time.  What did I really lose?  Potential Memories of sitting on my ass at some coffee shop, walking around Boise, riding my bike, being a mass consumer, smoking, painting, talking too much?  Nah....I could do all those things in my sleep in technicolor with distorted faces and recant them with the same ferver as those that actually transpired.

I have this overwheming desire to move to the east coast all though I know that will never happen.  My western naive existence is causing this ""left out"" feeling.  My friend Wison called me last night around midnight to rant about how his city was trite.  The fact that someone could envy boutiques spattered in the middle of nowhere when they live in a metropolis, is beyond me.  

I'm going to be in my friend Leann's wedding...  She called me last week to be one of her bridesmaids.  She promised the dress I'd have to purchase wouldn't be grotesque.  I've known her since highschool.   Honestly, we weren't friends at first.  She shared a seat with me in the English class prior to mine.  One particular day, she left her binder on the desk and when I found it, I read her journal entries, her essays, just other personal things...  Then I looked on the cover and she had some bands scrawled across the front and some misdrawn logos and correlations.  I carefully wrote out the origins of some of the bands and labels....with dates and names that she could easily reference.  Then I showed the binder to my friend, Paul who laughed and snatched it away.  He added his own little trivial music contributions.  After School, Paul and I put on masks and drove to Leann's house where we ripped her binder open and scattered its entrials across her front lawn.  
The following semester she sat behind me in a math class, and we formed an alliance against this kid named Jared...who would draw you to piss you off.  He'd stare at you and sketch and for some reason it bothered her more than seemed appropriate.  I thought she was going to cry every time...  We eventually started ditching school together, each time realizing there was nothing to do, and school would probably be more fun than sitting in my car, listening to mix tapes.  We expanded into shop lifting from a craft store, total loot costing around 89 cents.  Plastic eyeballs, rings, patches, and buttons....

I wonder if there are any smashing good shows around then.  
The record exchange guy is creepy.  He always says my name like I'm some sorta press person.....  It makes me uneasy...  Its weird because he's got one of those penetrating glances that make you feel like you're being visually violated.  Aside from my disdain for singing children, thats the highest ranking annoyance.  I hate it when people stare at me.....and make me feel all wierded out.  This annoying guy in highschool used to do that all the damned time and he knew it made me uncomfortable.....

"How does Too much relate to I was thinking how odd it would be if I put what would go in my ""actual"" journal in this.   I sincerely desire complete void of thought.  This nation is sick with its ""god bless america"" irony.  We salute, waive our flags and with the same hand over our hearts, we slap arab americans and those of any faith adverse to ours.  I say this in an inclusive manner, because although I feel separated from my fellow citizen right now, I cannot help but also feel that I only say these things from my cozy well-heated insulated faction of naivete.   We are one nation under god, above the law, and the ultimate judge.  A super ego out of control.  Since my departure from absorbing the current affairs of the world, I feel empty but relieved.  Being forced to listen to Dr. Laura enrages me, with no outlet to vent asside from my clever aquaintences...but what does that accomplish?  This feeling of helplessness is pervasive creating an environment for comradery, however this duel acceptance/resentment is tearing whats left of my loyalties to anything governmental.  
Symbolism is unavoidable in every facet of my daily life.  My routines have been disrupted to the tune of the national anthem.  The testimonials of those who lost someone dear, aggitate my senses, but I'm more annoyed that it bothers me than sympathetic to thier loss.  Everything out of Bush's mouth sounds like a one-liner from some summer action film.   ""we told them turn over the terrorists or face your ruin......they chose unwisely"".
So, now we attack a nation but our doublespeak to distinguish what separates ""us"" from ""them"" is licentious.  This afghan woman called the Dr. Laura show (what she was thinking?)... and attempted to comment on how she is saddended that her extended family in afghanistan are victims of our nations arrogant attacks, and was dramatically interupted by an enraged Dr. Laura....whose rebuttals....were..""you mean you are sad that the TALIBAN is hurting your people""!..... (repeat 4 times with increased intensity)....then she jumped into her speech, most likely hearing american anthems swelling in her head, as background music to her tyrade, claiming the she doesn't understand how the ""uneducated"" can call her show claiming that afghanistan is comprised of innocent people as well as the american designated ""evil-doers"".  She persisted to point out that when ""they"" made the delibererate attack on america, it was an attrocity, and what america is doing is ""defending"" our nations liberties.....  I've always heard that random cliche ""perception is reality"" and scoffed at that in disgust...  Obviously a majority of America's population agrees, therefore it is?  My own parents are in disagreement on this issue.  My father, who was in the navy for 22 years, agrees that ""something has to be done"" while my mother comments, ""I hardly call bombing a poor nation, war...its murder""  She encourages me to be complacent with my fellow americans as to not fuel the fires, as she's afraid of retaliation in the heat of patriotism.  If someone killed me, I'm assured a lovely portrayal on the nightly news as a militant anti-government anarchist.  How far from the truth is that?  I've had encounters with angry youths shouting epithets and attempting to acquire my social acceptance in their plight to kill all that is muslim/arab....or vaugely un-aryan.  In a sad way, I identify with the underdogs of this country.  This town always rejected my non-commited racial identy.  You have to be one or the other..... thats how it.  Dont question anything, or you'll perpetually be the rejected, the refused, the tormented.  I've adapted to this reality, quietly thinking its not my conception.

Now, I suppose I could've spoken to him, however I'm content with admiration from afar.  He's probably some right wing mountain biker/snow boarder/pot smoking/? type.  This town in littered with them.  The sad thing is you can never find these things out, until AFTER you've introduced yourself....then your stuck.  
Last night, Suzanne and I went to the neurolux (www.neurolux.com) and saw quite possibly two of the worst bands ever to exist.  Thank the lord, I cant remember the first bands name...maybe its subconsciously blocked from my memory...but I would describe them as a poverty stricken Mudhoney.  The singer had some sort of Mark Arm vocal thing going on but the music didn't fit... it was more Huey Lewis and the News or some cheese-ball good times sports bar rock.  But nothing compares to the complete crap that we heard from the second..... shock dismay ....""headlining"" band....  Stumbleblind.  I dont know how to describe this cacophonous blunder of bad playing vs. too many people on stage.  The first song with a medley of crap, that was self described as ""country""???!!  The next tune was the one that made us leave.  It had all these contrived dramatic pauses and uproarious cymbal crashes......  There was no discernible ""melody"" that I could find.  At least the ghetto Mudhoney, had some sort of rhythm to their shite.....  If I do remember correctly in one of thier 9 min songs, they repeated, ""when push comes to shove you hurt the one you love""....  It was in some pattern or timing....  So, yea..back to ""Stumbleblindlythroughsongsthatwecantplayorwrite"".... I really dont know what else to say about them because after the first three ear wrenching songs, we left.... and I'd like to point out I left almost an entire beer there....I mean this was BAD!!!!!  
So, aside from the uh......music..... I saw my ex-boyfriend's former best friend (Phil), and I simply want to point out that this guy deserves massive props for keeping a non-existent scene going as a one man show.  Dave gave up on the rockabilly jag at least a year ago, but good old Phil is still going strong.  He adorned himself in the cutest black framed glasses, plaid shirt with rolled up sleeves, and of course cuffed pants.  Now, I'm not sure about this, but Suzanne commented that he had an old Houston Astros hat.  I wonder if he has an ID photo of some guy from the 50's.  ah, oh well.....side bar, he's getting quite attractive..... dont get me wrong, I'm not into the rockosilly's, I just think ""he"" is easy on the eye....and he's super shy...  I remember he used to come over to my apt, and just sit there......wearing (hehhehahhahahha) sunglasses so he wouldn't have to make eye contact or speak......woa.......  If you spoke to him, he'd get even more shy.....

So, I have nothing more to say....I'm through being a 13 year old superficial girl.

"How does Pleasure from Denial relate to So, here I sit repulsed by a little encounter no less than 30 mins ago.  I feel completely stuck in this fucked up situation where one of the clients here can say really ""uh"" inappropriate things to me, and I cant do anything about it.  Noone will believe me because he acts like a cheeseball around everyone else, and always comments to people how I dont like him...  He knows damn well, why I dont like him.  I fucking want to cry, or quit, or I dunno....kick his ass.  He's fucking sick!!!  and he's married....  Noone pays attention!!!  He just sat right next to me and started whispering shit to me.....   then he acted all casual when my boss who was right next to me engaged in another conversation addressed him. ""oh Jenny's gonna take care of me"".... he said.

blech!!!!!  No I""M NOT!!!!!!!!!!!  
I cant say anything I want to, its like I just have to sit there and listen to this barrage of shit.
Then he starts facetiously asking for things in my bag, to which of course I said, NO.  I really just wanted him to go away.  So, in the most repugnant way, he says, and this seems to echo in my mind, ""you get pleasure from telling me No, dont you""?   It had an ominous tone and honestly I'm fucking freaked out.....so I just said, ""NO""?","Sorry, no answer found for Pleasure from Denial."

"How does Lord have mercy relate to Today is soooooooooooooooooooooo freaking boring.  Yes, we're making great revenue due to this continual request...but it leaves me with nothing to do except listen to ""talk of the nation"" (no more juan williams) and give myself typing tests.  I suck!! I only type 65 wpm.  I fell asleep on my desk and my boss, woke me up and told me to sleep in the breakroom......  So, I made my way to the couch of goodness, to be once again awakened by ""the devil"".  If you've read my previous entries you know who I'm referring to.... augh!! I woke up and practically ran back to my office.  So, I went to get coffee across the street and have a smoke.......  ahhh... but Mr. Evan coffee boy has decided to act all weird around me.  I dont usually care if other people act weird around me...I figure its their thing, but if you saw his previous demeanor, you'd feel uncomfortable too.  He used to get all weird and freak out, talking about random bands and local events.  Now, he makes me sooooooooooooooooooooooo uncomfortable.  I walked in today and he walked by me with this odd expression and said, ""hello...JENNY!!""  he yelled my name!!! augh!!! so of course I dont approach him.    He didn't yell it in a funny way, it was in this ...""I know your name, and I'm going to use it in the most derrogatory way possible""...not many options other than raising the volume.    Ever since he revealed his crush for Suzanne he acts weird around me... whats up with that?  I'm not talking shite about him, and neither is she, so this odd attitude is baffling.  Anyways, I should do something other than rant.  

I got this really lovely Live Bright Eyes CD from a Minneapolis show.....  Oh..how I love it.  I want to go to seattle to see Sorry About Dresden, Cursive, and Connor's new bandito.... despersa;lidfaskfh;difja?

Personally I would not have picked this place, but eh....  After about 30 mins of Hootin' and Hollerin' saturating the air and waving ""metal"" hands flying past my face, I started to wonder whether or not these people realized that Built to Spill was actually from here.  Many of the kids in the crowd seemed to be there, just to be there.  Now, I realize this was sorta lame, but when there is that pause towards the end of ""Big Dipper"" yet you know the song isn't over, a large portion of the crowd started clapping as if it were the end...   So, I pointed that out to my beloved friends and they just reassure me that I'm the only person that notices or cares about that and that I'm a ""snob""...so I got to thinking....eh?  A snob..? moi?  NO no no...anyone who likes built to spill would notice that and it would bother them on a certain level.... well, I decided to make a little quiz .....  An indie snob quiz.... its not that indie and really not that snob, but its fun...uh...I think....oh and it may have a pac northwest bias..... eh..whatever...

"How does I know Prince, I can have you fired!!!!!!!!! relate to This past week was a blur of slight hangovers, beer, music, attractive loser guys, and laughter.  I missed the Microphones last night because I decided to hit the Neurolux with my male allie, Max, whose new found bitter pessimism is more than just a downer. It was downright aggrivating.... I was on the verge of tears (drunk too), when he wouldn't stop telling me all relationships are pointless, and why bother ...blah blah blah....  

So, on Saturday, the self proclaimed ""super shy"" Evan practically hoisted sail on the lap of my ""just being nice"" friend, Suzanne.  I know this is possibly bitchy, but he was all over her and the whole thing makes me laugh hysterically....  She was begging me to pretend to be her lesbian girlfriend and she asked other guys to pretend they were with her to ward off his advances.  At one point, I lost my composure when this rat-looking guy hit on suzanne, but wanted to make sure Evan wasn't her boyfriend.  Needless to say, boise has a lack of decent guys.  There are the occasional walk throughs, but most leave.  
Last evening I found out that the adorably cute boy, Shawn is moving to Hell-A in two freaking days!!!  What the hell is that?  Nice warning.  For a 28 year old guy, he seems awfully lost as to what he wants out of life.  Its like he just lives with no particular ambition or anything, which has a lot to do with why I dont talk to him.  I dont know what to say.... Me, the girl who never shuts up, has nothing to open with.  He doesn't seem extremely musical, he skateboards (uhh....), and he works as a cook.  I asked him if he was into culinary arts and he shot that down.  Maaan, I dont get him at all, but I suppose that matters less since he'll be in my geographical nemesis.  When I left L.A., I could'nt be happier about my decision.  The most vacuous place on earth should be on billboards as you enter the city.  bah!!!  

So, the search for a decent waffle boy goes on..... enough of these pancake boys....and even more frightening, coffee and toast boys....  gasp!!! boys that skip breakfast all together... oh, sweet waffle boys, if you're out there, share your kitchen space, and speak up.  The fast food nation of losers is too prevalent.?","Sorry, no answer found for I know Prince, I can have you fired!!!!!!!!!."

                    We don't need a psychic to tell us
                    that you're giving off a Crimson
                    vibe. Your ruby-red aura reveals
                    your passionate, sensual nature —
                    you're all about earthly pleasure.
                    Whether you're getting a great
                    massage or having a sumptuous
                    dinner, you delight in experiences
                    that fully engage your senses.
                    (Crimson is, after all, the color of
                    roses, wine, and velvet.) That's why
                    it's the material things that really
                    float your boat. If you can taste it,
                    touch it, smell it, or see it right here,
                    right now, you're all over it. After all,
                    you're firmly rooted in reality,
                    preferring to live in the present
                    rather than the future. And you
                    probably have a quick temper, too —
                    most folks with red auras do. But
                    you cool down quickly, turning your
                    outspoken energy and stamina to
                    projects with fast, concrete results.
                    A hot-blooded go-getter like you is
                    always in favor of instant
                    gratification.

      Red

      Your color is red, the color of racy sportscars,
      blushing cheeks, and luscious roses. Red
      symbolizes passion, romance, and love. So, since
      you're ruled by red, you probably trust your
      feelings more than your brain and tend to act
      spontaneously. If you see something you want,
      you go for it without thinking twice — impulsive is
      your middle name. You don't wait around for
      people to make decisions, either; you dive right
      in. Quite the romantic, you pay close attention to
      your emotions. In fact, if your heart isn't in what
      you're doing, you won't be satisfied. Of course,
      even when you do pour all your energy into the
      projects you tackle, your impetuous nature means
      your passions can shift as frequently as the wind.
      That's why some reds have trouble with
      commitment. Our advice? Next time you're feeling
      fickle, think before you act, if possible. You might
      be surprised at the results. Overall, though, it's
      great to be red. No one lives life more completely
      than you do.?","Sorry, no answer found for uh......... this is bogus."

"How does NIght of the living Dead relate to After I got off work yesterday, I decided to head to SoHO and read my lovely book, while sipping warm cups of caaawfee.  Low and behold, of all people who plaugue my and suzanne's existence, Tex Mex happened by.  This is this incredibly arrogant, attractive, indie-rock-esque, more brit-pop, lad whose impossible to figure out.  Suzanne has a little wink wink for him, but he's just confusing as all hell.  Last week, she told Aaron of her attraction and he told another guy she was into him, hehehehe...so that guy wanted to meet her... then after she set him straight, he told the Tex, but he completely ignored tact.  Tex was sorta helping out with the grand task of running Kareoke, and A-Dawg just went up on the stage of the Neurolux and told him right there, as if this was some horrid play.  Needless to say, Suzy was humiliated...and well I think Tex just seems like an ass.  ....blah blah blah

So, anyways, I got locked out of Suz' apartment last night and was stuck downtown for hours.  I went to the neurolux to uh.....get drunk and kill time, and all these Nasty old men were hitting on me.  I'm not talking 30 year olds or even 40 year olds.... oh no the full on 50-60's...what the Fuck is up with that?  I was down right rude to this one man who gave me the creeps....he looked like Uncle Fester....... oh...I'm getting creeped out right now.  
Flying solo at bars=not a good idea.  The only redeemingly interesting guy turned out to be buying drugs, so my interest once again...... dissolved.  I think I'm going through a thirteen year old girl phase of some sort...

When I had coffee today, the boy whose moving to L.A. was there and he came at sat with me after my friends left.  We talked a bit and I think I came off as negative or just uh......... I dunno...it was all awkward..probably because he knows I have a crush on him...anyhow, this whole time I convinced myself he was lame and that way it was no big deal that I never got to really know him...but he's NOT!!! He's actually really intelligent and super nice and Hawt!!!! and this fucking sucks..  He's even got good style.... ahhhhhhhhhhh.....  why does every guy I ever get interested in or get together with leave?  If fate exists, its definately against me.  My ex boyfriend in college and I were sooooooooooooooo in Love and than he switched schools for his major.  We tried to keep it going but it didn't work out, and I still regret that...  Countless others just decide to leave...I think it has a lot to do with Idaho and how much it sucks here and how anyone with goals cant achieve any of them while living here...  Anyways, Shawn isn't dumb, he's attractive and he's moving... I guess I am too but .......sigh....Oh well.... I think I need to get to know him better before he goes..........

I just got out of the elevator from hell.....all these people are on lunch and the combination smells of their grotesque food was nauseating.  Plus, this one lady insisted on sharing her crockpot recipes...which honestly sounded like she didn't know how to cook.  eg.  throw a roast in a crockpot with a can of Ragu....  in an hour you have dinner....... or death.... I dont know which comes sooner...or which you'd prefer.  

Soho as usual....  Hey, seattle peeps email my friend Matt (methurston@micronpc.com) with show info for this weekend..he's going to be in seattle and needs shows....needs..... good guy..hook him up.  His tastes vary...but for example he talked ad infinitum about minneapolis bands last night....uh he's from there

So, I spoke to Mr Lovely again today...he's shy....  but I found out that he has really cool aspirations.  I realize he's leaving soon, but I really want to know him.  He's obviously running away from a shitty situation, to a shitty town, that will probably fullfill some hedonistic need for him, but I dont feel that he's necessarily a pleasure seeker.  Despite his exit from Idaho thus my world, I really hope he finds whatever he's looking for.   Soon I'll be heading away from here, and I'm intimidated for some fucked up reason.  Living in L.A. did such a disservice to my confidence in being self sufficient.  I failed in every aspect of life.  No job to save my life, my relationships dissoved, and I stood up for the unpopular girl, causing an isolation that really fucking hurt.  I spent christmas alone... normally I wouldn't think that would be such a big deal, but alone doesn't even begin to represent the feeling of knowing people around you are celebrating and exchanging gifts and you're watching ""shield around the K"" over and over and over.... till you memorize tedious facts about Rose Melberg, Calvin Johnson...and KAOS (a station I've never even heard!!!).?","Sorry, no answer found for I hate to be a bother."

I'd say more, but for some reason, I just feel that this format is really voyeuristic and now I think I should shut up and write critiques of albums or political rants.

A cup of ice water fell on my lap, while the bitter cold wind blew, freezing my legs and allowing me to look like I pissed my pants.  Also, Mr wonderful seemed not that great today.  I had coffee with Sara and he joined but I noticed things I'd never noticed before (isn't this always how it is?).  For instance, he isn't as intelligent as previously admired.  Some of his comments seemed a little aimed toward the crass, and as of these last few days, he's acted so aloof.  I dont think any form of discussed correspondence is necessary.  There would be no positive outcome, nor would it have potential for anything.  I think I'm going to stick to people I have more in common with.  Somehow, I overlooked so many things, which I now see.  Jeremy was right.  I do go for the unattainable...maybe out of fear of rejection or possibly because I'll always have these wonderful ""what could've been"" stories.  Screw all that... I'm never going for unattainable again... If the lad isn't emotionally or in this case, ""physically"" available, I'm just going to dismiss it entirely.

Its as if I've never really known anyone, and they've never known me.  Most people seem content with the false sense of belonging, and the casual smiles, so why cant I?  The only reason I've ever been guarded around others is because its as if they dont want to really know.  Every now and then I just break down and wonder what the fuck am I doing?  Who the hell am I?  Why am I here?... wherever that may be... Why do I do what I do... what do I do?  And the most frustrating thing is that when people try to assimilate with me and share their common situations, I look at them like... you're five words away from fucking me over.

               Character counts 

               Just a year ago, the Democrats wanted New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to
               resign. Now they want him to stay on past his legal term. 

               Just a year ago, the Democrats were saying that George W. Bush didn´t
               understand foreign policy. Now they are saying he´s great and they are
               glad he´s president under current conditions rather than Al Gore. 

               Both Giuliani and Bush are being highly praised by leaders from around
               the world. 

               Just a few years ago, the Democrats were saying that ""character doesn´t
               matter"" when they were defending Bill Clinton. Now they use the word
               character to describe the heroes of Flight 93, the NYPD and the FDNY. 

               It seems ... the Democrats have great hindsight. 

                                                            Hap Cole, Boise 

             

               Siding with evil 

               The vast majority of Muslims around the world (80 percent in Indonesia,
               Pakistan and other Arab nations) claim that we are waging war against
               Islam. By their very words, these Muslims align themselves with evil so
               dark it routinely seeks out to cowardly butcher thousands of innocents in
               the name of Allah. 

               If Islam and the Quran implicitly, or explicitly, condone the despicable
               dogma of Osama bin Laden or the Taliban, then Islam itself is the catalyst
               for evil. And this does, indeed, put us at war with Islam. 

               If Muslims think this is a bad rap, maybe they should make it vocally clear
               that the Taliban and bin Laden, et al., are not Muslims. And maybe even
               encourage the destruction of this scourge -- during Ramadan.

Why they made me come in today is beyond comprehension.   I'm sitting here violating their rules, listening to mix tapes created by an assortment of people, wondering why the hell I'm even here.  There aren't any jobs, and management is on vacation for today.  Noone else places job requests, asside from the suits, because noone else has an RC code.  How to make this mundane day go faster... hmmm....  I think I'm going to go to the Record Exchange and talk to the owner.

This may seem harsh, but Its odd how you can talk to someone continually in brief interactions, all the while maintaining enough mystery to still think they possess some shred of sociability.

I've avoided going outside today, so that if in fact it DID snow, I wont have to see it.  Snow is only pretty for the first 30 mins after it stops...than its hell...  SUV morons think they can drive at regular speeds and kill everyone... if you're walking the piles of black sludge drench you, as the inevitable cars drive up next to you.  Your feet are perpetually cold and damp... If you own shoes with no traction, you're destined to forget and wear them in the snow... causing you to slide and slam on the ground repeatedly... till you can take them off.  With all this in mind, I dont think it did snow... probably just rained.  Its only been snowing in small intervals.  

This morning I saw graphic accident scene.  This minivan was flipped over and there was blood all over the road, and a stuffed bear.

"How does SNOW!!!!!!!!!!!! relate to Snow is insulating my car as I type.   I'm not looking forward to the drive home.  Everytime I've driven in snow, a horrific accident has unfolded near me or involving me.  In the winter of 97, I was driving to my friend, Jessicas house to have many beers, when upon my cars approach to Rose Hill, the car started sliding backwards down the hill..... it was so damned scary... Thankfully, the lads behind me, got out of their garganutuan truck and pushed my car up the hill.....  all while I sat there and freaked out.  Another time, I had this jackass in a mercedes hit the back of my car, as he was too close when he stopped, and he sent my car spinning into the other lanes of opposing traffic...  So, of course all those cars slammed on their brakes and went sliding everywhere.  No damage was done, but it was really scary...  It damaged my pshyche.  And the worse part of that was that the Mercedes asshole  left the scene not even slightly concerned if they had sent me to my metal twisted icy death.  

Moral of this story is that snow is the tool of the devil and mercedes drivers, the minions.?","Sorry, no answer found for SNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!."

I just ended a simulataneous conversation with Jeremy on Line 1 and Aaron on Line 2 and attempted to lure one or both of them into having coffee with me ... to no avail.  They both have ""busy"" errands to run.  aka. whipped by gfs'.  They do lead relatively busy lives... compared to a slug like myself.  Aaron is in school, completing his degree(s) in Philosophy/Canadian Studies ?/Sociology/Physics/... and I believe he only has one year to complete all of them.  If asked what he want to do with his life, he usually describes and island under a communist regime, with absolutely no ""non-thinkers"".  Jeremy is of the opposite persuasion.  His days are cosumed with selling meat products from here to Wyoming.  When he's not revealing the joys of Honey Baked Ham, he lays around his cramped apartment that he shares with Stephanie, listening to wretched punk rock, with his shirt off, rubbing his belly, and purusing the channels of daytime t.v. (crossing over).  

non-sequitor... every time I go to their apartment they have some random imported beverage... ie.  chinese root beer...  Icelandic  Ginger Ale. ?????

Ultravylent can expect some ""badical"" address labels, made using the pics on her livejournal and assorted pics of my choosing.  Work is dull as hell today. (not that its ever the delight of my world).

So, of course as this turn of events take place... the asshole manager from upstairs comes to my office amidst our conversation... and says, ""Jenny, you actually talk to this moron?""  
Me: ""yea.. he's great to talk to"" 
Tom:(motions to benevolent manager) ""Get out of here!""
Me: So, what do you want?
Tom: That prick to leave

I officially gave my notice today even though its in advance but I'm debating on whether or not to tell mr. FuckFace Tom just why I hate him so much... since he always asking... but I'm constantly silenced by fear of retribution.  I despise him!!! I want him to be violently ripped limb from limb... violent but slow so his nerve endings stagnate with physical pain.  This is how he makes me feel... with his fucked up perversed sexual comments he thinks noone knows about.. his fucked up threats to me... his infantile thwarts to anyone I dont hate... 

I hate this motherfucker... now... to tell or not to tell... that is the question.?","Sorry, no answer found for Upper Management."

My record player is going to leave me for my parents, which means I wont even be able to listen to one of beloved albums newbies..but if the guy sends it soon... I can commit the sound to cassette.   

This morning Suzanne and I watched the Hewlett's Daughter video from my CD single which by the way there is no point in buying both of them.  They have the same songs on them... one has more.. I think its the pink one... I forget.  

It took me a fucking hour and a half to get to boise today... (normal eta: 30 mins) due to snow and idiots.

"How does Thai Hangover relate to My misery only begins with the physical symptoms I'm now experiencing.  Last night we went to this pricey new Thai restaurant for Suzanne's going away get-together.  This isn't especially note-worthy, only a nod to my current nausea.

Later we agreed to get some drinks at the Neurolux.  Suzanne dropped me off and took my car to ""Kool Keith's"" apartment to give him his holiday ""greeting"".  Obviously I didn't want to be present among such festivities.  So, I sat alone at the neurolux drinking my vanilla stolli and cokes, chain smoking, casually noticing people from my ancient boise past.

Then everything got really lame.  Theo walked in with his fellow sushi chef co-hort, Robbie and they sat with me.  Theo had this really silly grin, and quickly he was waaaaaaay too close to me.  The truely horrid part was that I was fast approaching ""drunk"" status and didn't notice.  In fact, I was flirting with him... NO!!!!!!!  Eeewww, I remember getting uber ""touchy-feely"" and somehow me saying, ""I only like catholic boys""...and him replying with ""I'm catholic!""... which he's not, but I only remember that when I'm sober...what the fuck is that?  First of all, I've only ever dated one catholic guy and he believed Nancy Regan was behind the Straight-Edge movement, so my little declaration is crap.  The only ex I ever loved was Jewish...eh go figure.  

Little blurbs of last night keep popping in my mind and I'm getting post-tramatic-embarassment.  Theo's little sister is marrying my friend, and somehow we got on that subject and ended up with him telling me that he'd give me the ""hookup's""  if I visited him at work... and something about riding on his scooter and his vintage bike...fuck I dunno.  I just feel super lame.  Suzanne eventually showed up, sober, and I guess I promised we'd go to Zuttos (sushi hipster restaurant theo works for).  Suzanne is obsessed with sushi.  I could care less, but damn it,  she called today and I fear we may be having sushi for lunch.  NO!!!!!!  I cant look theo in the face.... ewwww  what the hell.  I'm not drinking anymore!!!!!!

They may prevent me from leaving here as planned.  I have NO money.  I cant borrow from anyone.  I cant pay my phone bill.  I have NO gas to get to work tomorrow.  I'm lucky I made it today.  I had to go to the restroom to fucking cry, because I'm so stressed out, and didn't want my boss to witness my pathetic dissent.   The only solace I have is that I'm going to find out, where, who, and what they got with my tiny earnings.  Thanks to this shithead, I cant do anything this weekend that requires money.  Yea, my friends are like, dont worry about it... but I cant help but worry.  I've never been this negative... it feels so stressful... plus the bank ""says"" their gonna help me, but what if they charge me for all the overdrafts.  My mom just yelled at me...

This week somehow managed to sorta dissipate.  I wouldn't say its gotten necessarily better, its just ceased to completely suck.  Suzanne called me four times yesterday from the road.  It was sweet, but it perpetuates my denial that she moved.  I guess Keith is upset about her departure from our lives...  I think he and I should go get wasted in memory of Suzanne, but I'm not motivated enough to do anything.  I really ought to go out tonight, but Its just so weird without her now.  Also, if I go out tonight, I'm hanging out with a bunch of boys, not that I dont like boys, but its not the same.  Boys act stupid when their drunk, especially the ones I'm around.  Keith gets kinda pissy when he's drunk, Matt stays the same, just a little more talkative, and Aaron just becomes a fucking pervert, with his hands all over any girl sitting by him.  Either way, yea... it would be nice to see Mr. Ben, and I guess It'd be interesting to see Sean (boy who moved to L.A-emailed me saying he's in town for holidays), but it'd be just as fun to sit at home.  

I'm gonna call Maria tonight... thats right Britpopcoppola, Its all you!!!  
I had a dream that was old school LBC, and damn it... there was something... oh shit.. yea!!!! When Maria did her Regis impression... that was fucking in my dream.

Not terribly noteworthy but amusing... well to me.
The mailroom nazi, Luke, once described himself to me as ""emo"".  While choking back the inevitable hysterics, I pondered why he'd be so self-professing, when he's not even cool enough to be ""emo"".  I'm by no means saying that emo=cool.  I'm just saying that right now, the sound emminating from his packaged, postal regime is Enya.

Suzanne wanted me to listen to this song on the mix cd that Keith made for her.  She said it made her sad... but it never really did anything to me...  Its playing now, and its definately making me think.  
Maria said that when I move to Seattle, she thinks it will erase much of the drama of California, and in a way, she'd be right if it didn't actually spark more of remembrance of a certain evildoer.  Its harsh to say, I wish I'd never met her, but now I just wish she'd never left.  This cd is depressing!!!?","Sorry, no answer found for How can you not like ""wish fullfillment""?."

My phone died this weekend while I was online so I've been using my dad's cell phone which sucks because noone can call me.  This weekend was spent being lazy, which was actually kinda nice.  Last night, right before I went to bed, I drank a glass of milk.  This isn't an activity to be considered a norm.  My dream last night was filled will lactose intolerance, or the naggin fear of such.  My ignorance on lactose intolerance is evident, as it was portrayed as this evil shadow, and I was petrified with fear.?","Sorry, no answer found for Imelda and Diego."

"How does Aghast!@#$ relate to Its 15 degrees outside, and on my lunch I planned on sitting outdoors, smoking, enjoying a gargantuan cup of coffee.  In actuality, I sat with this hipster boy, going on about something or another... I wasn't paying attention.. so much that I still dont remember his name, thats why I usually refer to him as ""sweater boy"".  I suppose I could call him ""glasses boy"", but sweater boy seems to fit him.  So, after being bored to death on the trivial goings on of ""little megan"" (whoever the hell that is), I got up and walked four freezing cold, teetering on the edge of death, blocks to the Record Exchange.  I vowed not to buy anything; not to give them the satisfaction of taking my hard earned money, and more importantly, saving what meager earnings I have till I get to Seattle (and learn what poverty is all about).  Well, those bastards must've planned it!! They knew I was on my way.   Cackles and Hollers must've been heard as I approached, because as I opened the great glass door to the Edge (of sanity), they were playing the new Jay Farrar.  Matt (local neurolush) had told me of the great new album, but I didn't hear of it... I dont like to be swayed by people gushing on about solo albums being better than this and that.... family trees of who and what not.  I managed to stave off the musical lust, but eventually, I somehow rationalized the purchase of that and 5 other albums ... only 2 were used!!!! augh!!! I'm so broke...   
Upon my arrival back at the workplace, I was subjected to the gratuitous use of such adjectives as ""tepid"", ""lucid"", and ""tawdry"".  For Chrissakes, I work for Xerox... such words are not necessary!  They were all used out of context and each contrived delivery made my mind cringe.  
To escape, I called my bank (woo hoo!!)... than Mr Kendall called, so I'm broke going on broke(r).  I aggreed to drinks at the Neurolux at 9.  I'm intrigued to see what this lad has to offer by way of conversation, but further disturbed by the fact that I never associated with him in high school other than background interactions.  This should be uncomfortable, awkward, and if I drink enough, nauseating.  I suppose the order of which will unfold at 9.?","Sorry, no answer found for Aghast!@#$."

"How does Neurolux 101 relate to Where to begin...  Well, I met Jeff last night for drinks and I sorta figured the whole thing would be all weird.  In actuality it was amusing.  He was there before me, so he had already started drinking.  Once I arrived, we spoke of the usual high school crap and what was going on in our respective lives.  It was all nice and dandy.  My friends, Matt and Aaron even showed up and sat with us.  Apparently Matt knows a lot about scooters... (Jeff's passion).  Than, out of freaking nowhere, Jeff just got pissed drunk.  He was giving me those, ""hey there pal"" punches and calling me ""bitch"", and than kissing my head and smothering me telling me how great I am.  It was so odd.  I'm a fairly reserved person, which I could tell aggitated him.  He kept telling me not to be so cold, and to lighten up.  I'm just not one of those people who gets crrrrrrazy when I'm drunk.  He's a Bipolar drunk... very hard to read. Honestly, despite how it may have seemed  I thought it was an entertaining evening. 

 Suzanne's Keith told me how much he loved her... which was sweet... mainly due to his inflection. 

 My scarf is still at the neurolux, which upsets me... its one of my favorite... I almost forgot my wallet, due to my abrupt exit.  It was getting late-ish and my eyes were losing the ability to focus  so I opted to head off to my other friend Aarons and crash on his couch... which some other guy was sleeping on.. so I had to sleep in a love seat.  Not very comfortable.  With my legs bent over the arm rest portion, and only a tiny throw pillow and thin blanket to provide comfort, I stared up, out the window, watching the little flakes of snow fall from the purplish sky... until the alarm went off...  I'm soooooooooooooooo tired.?","Sorry, no answer found for Neurolux 101."

"How does I need a vacation from thinking relate to How the fuck do people meditate?  Last night I stayed up playing guitar till the wee hours of the morning.  I've come to this empasse in my life where all I want to do is knit and play guitar.  At some point, I figured I'd go to sleep, seeing as I needed to be here (work) by 7AM, but eh...whatcha gonna do? Sometimes you just need to stay awake and not talk to anyone... to just sit in isolation with yarn and strings...  
So, finally I made a deal with my brain, that I'd sleep if I could wake up on time and have a clear sign that I had to go to work...  My dream last night was so bizarre... I wont go into detail because I hate recanted dreams too, but it had a ""sport"" of some kind where all these geriatrics were throwing bowling pins at me and if they hit the wall behind me to the right they won, if it was to the left, I got to throw the pins back... and I hit some of them hard... than somone threw an umbrella at me, and I woke up, because they all started yelling. So, I turned on the tv and the White Stripes were on tv... hmm????  Weird... oh well.... I got up anyways.
